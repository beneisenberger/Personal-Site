            <p>I'm an Omaha, Nebraska-based guitarist, songwriter, web developer, and a graduate
                of both the University of Nebraska at Omahaâ€™s classical guitar program and the Midland University Code
                Academy. My debut solo
                release <a href="http://beneisenberger.bandcamp.com/album/three-islands">Three Islands</a>, a
                collection of warm
                and pensive acoustic songs, was released
                on April 24th, 2018 on cassette and digitally. A nationwide solo tour followed in
                September of 2018, and a midwest and southern tour in March 2019.
                <br><br>
                In 2015, I co-founded the experimental collective Screaming Plastic,
                which has released two cassettes of live improvisations and whose debut
                album was funded by a <a href="https://www.newmusicusa.org/projects/screaming-plastic/">New Music
                    USA</a> grant. I also play guitar in the band Hussies,
                who have been active in the Omaha music scene since 2012, and released our latest cassette, "Fast" in
                early 2019.
                <br><br>
                For web development, I have a strong fountation in Angular 6+, HTML5, CSS, JavaScript and TypeScript,
                SQL, Bootstrap and Material Design, Google Firebase/Firestore, NodeJS and Express. Most of my projects
                are built using these frameworks, but I am currently trying to expand my knowledge with other frameworks
                and libraries.
                <br><br>
                In addition to original music, I also do contracted work for musicals, choirs,
                and weddings, teach private lessons, and spend my free time dreaming up new coding projects and
                collaborating with other developers.
